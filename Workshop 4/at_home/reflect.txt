In this workshop, I learnt about the decalaration of arrays, use of arrays, benefits of using parallel arrays for tabular representation and using loops for the input and output of the array variables.

-> The use of arrays made the input, output and arithmetic operations in the workshop very easy. For alternatives, I could have used a set of same type of variables, but by using this method I have to declare so many variables differently which will make my code longer and more prone to errors. Moreover, I would have to take care of the values of every different variable which would have made debugging the code a lot more harder. Therefore, I prefer to use arrays instead of using a set of same type of variables.

-> The use of matching arrays helped me a lot in this workshop. I used parallel arrays in outputting the temperatures entered by the users and the . The use of parallel arrays to output tabular information is the best method we can use, we just have to use a loop and an printf statement to output the whole table. I also used them in the calculation of total high and low temperatures which was very handy. The only thing which I didn't like about parallel arrays is if the array index is accidentally wrong then it will mess up the whole thing and produce unexpected results.

-> It is always best to start with 0 while working with loops and arrays together because an array index always starts from zero(0) and we can't change this behaviour so in order to match the behaviour of arrays, starting from 0 is the best practice to get the desired output without confusions and bugs.
