In this workshop, I learnt about structs. The main things were declaration of structs, initialization of structs and input/output of structs and array of structs. Moreover, I came to know how to use a combination of for loop and if-statements to search for a value inside an array of structs and modify it to another value.

-> By using array of structs, I was able to store different types of data of an employee into a single entry, for example, I stored the id(int), age(int) and salary(double) of employee into one entry which made me very easy to modify or view data while dealing with a single employee. As an alternative, I could have used parallel arrays but that could have increased the length of my code, more prone to errors and even more complicated and harder to understand, so I would prefer array of structs over it.

-> Declaring structs in a separate header file can be advantageous when there are more than one .c files in a program, we can include the header file by typing a single line of code to multiple files. Declaration in header files is also beneficial when we have to edit the declaration, we just have to edit the declaration in the header file and it implements in all the files where we included the header file.
