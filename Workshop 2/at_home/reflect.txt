The first thing that I learnt in this workshop is how to prompt a user to enter a value that the program can read. In addition, the use of modulus and division operator, importance of type casting and the behaviour of C compiler in rounding and trunacating of numbers, these are the things that I have learnt so far. 

The most interesting part of doing this workshop was itself the fact that I am creating a program that is actually useful to calculate the number of loonies,quarters,dimes,nickles and pennies in a given amount. Although, I faced some difficulty in trying to figure out a algorithm that will actually be accurate to display the correct balance which I ended up to use type casting.

Converting a float to an int to perform arithmetic operations is always best because some of the operators do not work on floats and the most useful one (% modulus) demands all values to be int type in order perform the operation. Moreover, everything stays clean because we don't have to worry about the value on the right side of the decimal point.

Using the modulus operator instead of division and subtraction is the thing that I would prefer due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that we don't have to do two things to do the same thing that we can do in one line using the modulus, which eventually decreases the length of the code and it becomes easy to spot errors. The second reason is that using the modulus do not complicate things, it just gives us the right answer that we can work with which is not the case in division and subtraction, I am saying this because I was using the division and subtraction method for calculating the balance at first which was just going over my head and later I used modulus which just solved everything instantly.
